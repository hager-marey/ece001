<h4>1. Complexity</h4>
<p>With IoT, there are chances of failure. Suppose, you and your friend got 
    a message that the milk packet kept in your fridge has expired. So, in this case,
     both of you will purchase a milk packet. There will be two packets which will result in wastage of money.
    This makes the entire process a bit complicated. To make this process a bit easy
    , it would be a wise option that you register or connect only one of your number with the IoT
     enabled device.</p>
<h4>2. Compatibility</h4>
<p>There are millions and billions of device that are connected with each other in the IoT ecosystem; however,
     all
     the devices are built by different manufacturers which raise the issue of compatibility in tagging 
     and monitoring.

    It is hard to convince every manufacturer that they built devices that agree to a common standard.
     Though Bluetooth can connect different devices, they may come up with compatibility issues even 
     if the IoT devices are ruling the world.
    
    This compatibility issue may force the buyers or users to buy devices from a specific manufacturer which
     may create a monopoly in the market.</p>
<h4>3. Privacy or Security</h4>
<p>There is a risk of losing privacy in data that is being transmitted through IoT devices. You need to see how well the data is being encrypted. Due to the rapid growth of IoT, it is facing security and privacy issues.

    IoT devices connected to your desktop or laptops increase the risk of leaking the customers’ personal information while the data is being collected and transmitted from the IoT device.</p>
<h4>4. Lesser Employment or Menial Staffs</h4>

<p>IoT is expanding across the globe, and this may result in the replacement of monotonous and unsafe jobs firing off unskilled professionals. All of this may create unemployment issues in society.

    With IoT, daily activities are getting automated, and naturally, there will be fewer requirements for human resources and less educated staff. Hence, mastering new ways of working will increase or stable the chances of a person’s employability.</p>
