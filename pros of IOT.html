<br><b>Easy Access</b>
<p>IoT can be put to many uses, but most of its use cases occur in real-time. All you need is a smartphone with internet connectivity. These two, when paired up together, make you and your life smarter.’

    Imagine your entire daily life is connected with devices and controlled by technology. How easier your life would be?
    
    When your refrigerator can identify that you have run out of milk and contact the nearest supermarket to order the same quantity that you usually used to have, IOT enabled devices will inform you by sending a text on your phone that you are running out of milk.
    
    Seriously, it makes our life way easier.
    
    Let’s suppose, your alarm rings at six o’clock in the morning and you being lazy switched it off. The moment, you will switch off your alarm, it will connect with the geyser and heat the water at the temperature you prefer. At the same time, it will instruct the coffee maker to start brewing the coffee; all without waking you up.</p>

<b>. Wireless technology turns cities into Smart Cities</b>
<p>To ensure that the electricity is not wasted, IoT-enabled devices manage street lights and automates everything. It automatically switches off street lights in daylight and switches them on during the onset of darkness.

    With the help of IoT devices, you can monitor the vibrations of buildings, bridges, monuments in case they are overloaded. These are the perfect examples of IoT in smart cities. Hospitals and schools can control noise pollution around them and maintain peace all around</p>

<b>Eases Communication</b>
<p>IoT encourages Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication (communication between devices) and allows you to control and automate taxes daily.

    Cisco calculates that machine-to-machine connections supporting IoT applications account for more than half of the total 27.1 billion devices and connections.</p>

<b>Saves Money</b>
<p>A report by DHL states that IOT will help a business save $1.2 trillion in productivity costs alone. Let’s see how it works. With IoT, electronic appliances effectively communicate with each other, thereby conserving and saving cost and energy.

    By allowing the data to be shared and communicated between electronic devices and then translating it into our required way, IoT is making our systems efficient.</p>
